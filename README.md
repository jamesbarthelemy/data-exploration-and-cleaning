# Data exploration and cleaning

In this project, I am going to walk you through the end-to-end data analysis process with Python and the OpenFoodFacts Dataset. 
The different goals are :

1. Process the dataset, by identifying relevant variables for future processing
2. Clean data by highlighting any missing values and identifying and quantifying possible outliers for each variable
3. Automate these treatments to avoid repeating these operations
4. Throughout the analysis, produce visualizations to better understand the data
5. Perform a univariate analysis for each variable of interest, in order to synthesize its behavior
6. Confirm or refute hypotheses using multivariate analysis
7. Perform the appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results
